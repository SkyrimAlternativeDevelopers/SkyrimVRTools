# SKSE-VRInputPlugin
Skyrim Script Extender Plugin to give mods access to VR controller input data.  Be warned this is currently an untested alpha version!

This plugin will use the API provided by artumino in PapyrusVR to give mod scripters access to VR input but it uses a different method of collecting OpenVR data which I think is more efficient and will be easier to update for SkyrimVR patches, it is also working with the current version of SkyrimVR/SKSE (1.4.15).
I may create a new script API that works more efficiently with this method of getting OpenVR data and also provides extra features as well.

Please see https://github.com/artumino/PapyrusVR for Papyrus script details.     

Thanks to the SKSE team at http://skse.silverlock.org/ and artumino for PapyrusVR at https://github.com/artumino/PapyrusVR for making this plugin possible and inspiring me to write it.  

Also a special thanks to Odie (https://github.com/Odie) for contributing Scaleform integration, and in general for his work on SkyUI-VR.
