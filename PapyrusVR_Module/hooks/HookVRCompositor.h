	*	2. (Optional) To avoid having WaitGetPoses access the Vulkan queue so that the queue can be accessed from
	*	another thread while WaitGetPoses is executing.
	*
	* More accurate GPU timestamp for the start of the frame is achieved by the application calling
	* SubmitExplicitTimingData immediately before its first submission to the Vulkan/D3D12 queue.
	* This is more accurate because normally this GPU timestamp is recorded during WaitGetPoses.  In D3D11,
	* WaitGetPoses queues a GPU timestamp write, but it does not actually get submitted to the GPU until the
	* application flushes.  By using SubmitExplicitTimingData, the timestamp is recorded at the same place for
	* Vulkan/D3D12 as it is for D3D11, resulting in a more accurate GPU time measurement for the frame.
	*
	* Avoiding WaitGetPoses accessing the Vulkan queue can be achieved using SetExplicitTimingMode as well.  If this is desired,
	* the application should set the timing mode to Explicit_ApplicationPerformsPostPresentHandoff and *MUST* call PostPresentHandoff
	* itself. If these conditions are met, then WaitGetPoses is guaranteed not to access the queue.  Note that PostPresentHandoff
